This is the default jQuery UI theme ported to Sass.

It's an attempt to have a base theme to build from that does not require ThemeRoller.

Why? Basically, because however awesome ThemeRoller may be, making a custom theme by hand
can be more powerful & flexible.

Sass (from Haml) provides lots of useful things, such as constants.

This is a WIP. Feel free to fork, make improvements, and send pull requests.
